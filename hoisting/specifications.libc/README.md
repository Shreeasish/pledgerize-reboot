# Scripts
- libcag
Runs ag at a given location and checks it with the list of libc functions (hardcoded into the script)
- finfo
Checker for function privileges

# Files
- final-closures

Different from all-closures-stripped-kernel.
`fts_read` does not require `PLEDGE_WPATH` according to final-closures.
